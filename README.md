# sampling_assignment
we apply different sampling techniques and use them to train different maodels. The we determine which sampling works best for each model.

as we can see from the results after running the attached file, all the models give an accuracy score of 0.9935 on sampling echniques 2,3 and 4. so we can say that samplng techniques 2, 3 and 4 which are Randomoversampler, SMOTE,TomeLinks work best for each model. Also from scores we can see that model 5 which is Extra tree classifier is best model.
